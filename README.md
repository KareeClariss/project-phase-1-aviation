**HAZARD AND RISK ANALYSIS FOR AIRCRAFTS OPERATIONS** 

**1. Business Understanding**
Accidents are mostly inevittable. However, identifying patterns that led to these accidents in the past may help tailor our decission as we dive into this industry.
 As a team aspiring to venture into the aviation industry, we are curious about:
 
* Is air as a mode of transport becoming safer with time
* What is the effect of weather conditions to aircraft accidents
* Do varying engine types present different levels of risk
* Is there a correlation between an aircraft make and its damage
* Effect of flight purpose to accidents
* What category of an aircraft is safer
* 
**2. Data Understanding**
  
For this research, we collected data from kaggle which contains information from 1962 and later about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents within the United States, its territories and possesions, and in international waters.
Each record(row) represents information about a certain plane accident incident.
Each column contains a different type of data related to that incident. We are mostly dealing with the following columns:

* Event.Date : The date when the accident occured
* Location : The state/ exact place where the accident occured
* Airport.Name : The airport where the subject plane took off from
* Injury.Severity : How critical were the inuries from the accident
* Aircraft.Damage : The impact of the crash on the plane
* Make : The type of aircraft
* Total.Fatal.Injuries
* Total.Serious.Injuries
* Total.Minor.Injuries
* Total.Uninjured
* Weather.Condition
* Among other categories as we shall explore later in the analysis
