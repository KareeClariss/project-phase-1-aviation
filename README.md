Aviation Accident Patterns in the United States (1962–2023): A Data-Driven Safety Insight

**Introduction**

Air travel is generally safe, but when accidents occur, the consequences can be severe. This project analyzes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 in the United States. By identifying trends in location, time, weather, and injury outcomes, we aim to provide actionable insights that can help improve aviation safety and reduce future risks.

**Project Objectives**

* Identify the states and cities with the highest number of aviation accidents.

* Understand the environmental and weather-related factors that contribute to accidents.

* Analyze when (year, month, day) accidents are most likely to happen.

* Explore patterns in injury severity.

* Provide recommendations for enhancing aviation safety based on findings.

**Business Understanding**

Airlines, aviation regulators (like the FAA or NTSB), and safety organizations need data-backed insights to reduce accident rates. Understanding historical trends helps in better planning, resource allocation, and development of policies that prioritize safety and minimize accidents, especially in high-risk areas or periods.

**Data Understanding**

Dataset Source: U.S. aviation accident records (1962–2023).

**Key Features Used:**

* ev_state: State where accident occurred

* ev_city: City of the accident

* ev_year, ev_month, ev_day: When it happened

* light_cond: Lighting condition (day/night)

* wx_cond_basic: Weather at the time

* sky_cond_ceil: Sky ceiling condition (e.g., clear, overcast)

* inj_fat, inj_ser, inj_min, inj_tot, inj_none: Types of injuries

The dataset had over 225,000 records and included a variety of weather, temporal, and geographic indicators
